"""
Gather all metadata/annotations requirements for an object part of the schema.org metadata model.

Assumed semantic sugar for requirements:

- requireChildAsValue: a node property indicating that the term associated with this node
    can be set to a value equal to any of the terms associated with this node's children. 

    E.g. suppose resourceType has property requireChildAsValue set to true and suppose
    resourceType has children curatedData, experimentalData, tool, analysis. Then 
    resourceType must be set either to curatedData, experimentalData, tool, analysis.

- requiresDependency: a relationship type corresponding to an edge between two nodes/terms x and y.
    requiresDependency indicates that if a value for term x is specified, then a value for term y 
    is also required.


    E.g. suppose node experimentalData has requiresDependency edges respectively to assay and dataType.
    Then, if experimentalData is specified that requires that both assay and dataType are specified
    (e.g. in annotations of an object).


This semantic sugar enables the generation different kinds of validation schemas including:
    - validate that all required annotation terms (i.e. properties) of an object are present in the 
    annotations json file associated with this object
    - validate that the value provided for a given property of an object is within a set of admissible values
    for that property
    - validate conditional annotations: if a property of an object is set to a specific value x, check if value 
    x requires any additional annotation properties to be specified for this object. E.g. if resourceType
    is experimentalData, require also that annotations/properties assay, dataType are set. 
    This support cascades of conditional validation (of arbitrary lengths).
